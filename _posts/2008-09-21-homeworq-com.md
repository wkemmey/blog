My <a href="http://graykemmey.com">son</a> and I have finally launched <a href="http://homeworq.com">HomeworQ.com</a>, a web site we have been working on forever.  Yay!

So here's a little background:  Gray is in a program at high school that requires him to do a year-long research project each year.  Last year, his project was to investigate marketing techniques that could be applied to a web site, and as part of that we built HomeworQ.com.  We launched it near the end of the school year in a sort of rough state.  That way Gray could experiment with some marketing techniques and gather statistics on their effectiveness.  All went well and he got an A on the project.

Meanwhile, I spent some time this summer polishing the site, and finally released it for real last Monday.  It still has some rough edges, but it works reasonably well, and I wanted to get it out there.

By the way, if you happened to click on the link, you may have noticed that making web sites pretty is not my strength.

Anyway, what does it do?  It helps students keep track of homework - what's due or overdue, and what's been completed.  But it employs 'social software' techniques to make this easier - sharing assignments with others in the class (less data entry) and letting students comment on individual assignments.

One week later, we have 24 users and 94 assignments have been marked complete!
