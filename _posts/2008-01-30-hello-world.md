Welcome to my blog!  It seems fitting that I begin this blog with a blogging story:  My wife's workout partner told her that her daughter, <a href="http://lindseysnow.com/">Lindsey</a>, blogged, so my wife was checking out Lindsey's blog two nights ago and showing me a few things.  The next day I'm checking blogs in Google Reader, and <a href="http://www.smoothharold.com/">one of the guys </a>I've been reading for months links to his wife's blog.  It's Lindsey.  I've been reading his blog for maybe a year, and all this time I see his in-laws almost every week.  Crazy.
