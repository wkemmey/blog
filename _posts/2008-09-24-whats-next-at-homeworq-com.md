title: What's Next at HomeworQ.com

I mentioned that <a href="http://homeworq.com">HomeworQ.com</a> is still a little rough around the edges.  No promises about when these will see the light of day, but here are some of the things I'm working on:

- Allow editing of an assignment, but only by the person who created it.
- Let students delete (from their account) schools and classes they are no longer attending.
- If you hold your mouse over the avatar, the login name of that user is displayed.  Many users miss this, though, so let's just show the name under the avatar.
- Provide a separate style sheet for printing - it's pretty ugly now.
- Offer some way to reset your password if you forget it.
- Explain some of the input fields that may be confusing.
- Create an announcements banner so that everyone knows when new features are released.

There are several improvements planned beyond these, but this is what you can expect to see next.  Let me know in the comments if you have other suggestions!
