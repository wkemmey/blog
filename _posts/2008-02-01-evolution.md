Because I went to the Naval Academy back when the navy was pushing everyone to use Ada, that was the language of our college curriculum.  We used assembly or C or whatever as needed, but most classes used Ada.  We compiled everything on a mainframe, since at the time there was no Ada compiler that would run on a PC.  In my personal projects, and in two consulting jobs I did while still in college, I used Pascal.

I'm skipping some projects here, but fast forward a few years:  I'm out of the navy, I've managed to get an employer to take a chance on me as a programmer, and I'm learning Visual Basic.  This was version 3.0.  In VB, I could get something done so much more quickly, and it would look so much better, than in any language I had used before.  I know it won't help my geek cred to say so, but I loved VB.

Then came the web, HTML, ASP, etc., and finally .NET.  I thought it wise to learn VB.NET and C#, but because of the "toy language" image of VB, decided to focus on C#.  Truly, I think each has advantages and disadvantages, mostly minor.

Being in the consulting business, where your choices are dictated by the client's needs, I also learned a smattering of Java.  But I never really liked it.

In my current job, I do a lot of C programming.  C is a language that I appreciate for its simplicity and power.  C is also great for some types of programming because it doesn't do anything under the covers on your behalf.  You have complete control.  However, I miss the far greater productivity of higher-level languages.

I'm also doing some web work.  And like so many others, I have been led by Ruby on Rails to ruby, my all-time hands-down favorite programming language.  So far, there is no other language I've encountered that has the combination of power, readability, and conciseness that ruby has.  It is an elegant language.

I'm also getting into an SOA/portal project at work using several different Oracle server products for database, identity management, web services, etc.  Java, of course.  Still don't like it.
