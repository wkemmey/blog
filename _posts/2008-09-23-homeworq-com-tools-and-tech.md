So what kind of space-age technology does it take to <a href="http://homeworq.com">track your homework</a>?  For the curious, I'm using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, which I absolutely love.  I also use the <a href="http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master">restful_authentication</a> plugin, but I have heavily modified it beyond recognition for the particular needs of my site.

The web server is running <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">mySQL</a>, <a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a>, and <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">mongrel</a>.  I have given some thought to switching this to Apache with Passenger (mod_rails) so that I can more easily run PHP alongside Rails, but I'm not going to do it yet.

All are working out so far.  If you have any questions about my experience with any of these, don't hesitate to ask!

And thank you, open source world.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
